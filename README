This is is small utility to choose what commercials you want to hear 
when using the free version of the Spotify music service. When 
Spotify is playing, have spotify-filter-commercial-breaks running at 
the same time. When you hear a commercial that you dislike, run 
spotify-blacklist (preferrably create a launcher/shortcut to this 
script). Whenever Spotify plays a disliked commercial this utility 
will automatically mute the speakers until it's over.
